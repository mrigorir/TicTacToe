## Tic Tac Toe's rules

- The game start with both player choosing their names.
- Player 1 is playing as 'X', while player 2 plays as 'O'
- The game starts with player 1 choosing an available cell in the board and then player 2 choosing an available cell in the board
- A player wins by getting 3 cells marked with their letter, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally
- If none of the players is able to win before the board runs out of available squares it's declared a draw.
- Enjoy
